# FunnelFreedom All-in-One Platform: Affordable Pricing, Done-For-You Affiliate System, Unlimited Marketing Tools

So you're tired of juggling five different software subscriptions just to run your online business? Yeah, I've been there. You've got your funnel builder over here, your email platform over there, a CRM you barely understand, and a social media scheduler that costs more than your monthly coffee budget. It's exhausting, expensive, and honestly, kind of ridiculous.

That's where FunnelFreedom comes in, and trust me, this isn't just another "shiny object" in the already crowded marketing software space. It's actually something different—something that might make you rethink your entire tech stack.

<img width="2965" height="1886" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bebafdb-0fd3-4f08-bc58-b321a337775a" />

**What Makes FunnelFreedom Different?**

Picture this situation. You're a beginner affiliate marketer, or maybe you've been dabbling for a while without much success. You watch YouTube videos about building funnels, you read blog posts about email sequences, and everyone keeps telling you that you need all these different tools working together. The problem? Setting all that up feels like trying to assemble furniture from that Swedish store—except the instructions are in three different languages, and half the screws are missing.

FunnelFreedom was created by Jonathan Montoya, an affiliate marketer who's earned over a million dollars through affiliate programs. He recognized that most beginners don't fail because they lack ambition or work ethic. They fail because the technical setup becomes an insurmountable barrier. So he built FunnelFreedom as a white-label version of GoHighLevel, one of the most robust all-in-one marketing platforms available, but specifically tailored for affiliate marketers.

What does that actually mean? It means you get professional-grade marketing automation without needing a computer science degree to use it. The platform includes a drag-and-drop funnel builder, website creation tools, email marketing automation, SMS messaging, social media scheduling, a built-in CRM, calendar booking, and even native video hosting. Everything lives under one roof, and better yet, everything actually talks to each other without requiring complicated integrations or API keys you don't understand.

The real game-changer here is the done-for-you affiliate marketing system that comes bundled with the software. When you sign up for FunnelFreedom, you're not just getting empty software—you're getting pre-built funnels, proven email sequences, professionally produced videos, and a complete affiliate stacking ecosystem. You can literally plug in your affiliate links and start promoting within minutes, not months. For someone who's been stuck in "learning mode" forever, this shortcut matters.

**The Technical Stuff Without the Technical Jargon**

Let's talk about what you actually get when you sign up. The funnel and website builder uses a drag-and-drop interface, which sounds basic until you realize how powerful it is. You can create unlimited funnels and unlimited websites—no artificial limits based on your pricing tier. The templates are professionally designed, so even if your design skills peak at choosing fonts in Microsoft Word, your funnels will still look legitimate.

If you're ready to take control of your online business without getting buried under multiple software subscriptions and endless technical headaches, it's time to see what FunnelFreedom can do for you. 👉 [**Start your 14-day free trial here**](https://funnelfreedom.io?fpr=li40) and experience the difference of having everything in one place. The platform is designed specifically for people who want results, not complications.

Email marketing through FunnelFreedom operates on a pay-as-you-go model, which is refreshingly honest compared to platforms that charge you based on contact list size. You pay approximately $$0.001$$ per email sent, which translates to about 10,000 emails for just $$10$$. If you're just starting out and not sending massive volumes yet, this pricing model saves you serious money compared to traditional email platforms that charge $$50$$ to $$100$$ monthly just for list storage.

The SMS functionality is similarly straightforward. You can add a phone number to your account for under $$3$$ per month (including governmental taxes), and then text messages cost roughly $$10$$ for approximately 970 texts in the United States. For affiliate marketers who want to add SMS follow-ups to their nurture sequences, this provides a cost-effective channel without committing to expensive SMS platforms.

What really sets FunnelFreedom apart is its CRM and automation capabilities. The customer relationship management system lets you track every interaction with your leads and customers. You can see who opened which emails, who clicked which links, who watched your videos, and where people are dropping off in your funnel. This data-driven approach replaces guesswork with actual insights, so you can optimize what's working instead of randomly trying different tactics.

The advanced automation builder allows you to create sophisticated marketing sequences without coding. Think of it like building with Lego blocks—you connect triggers, conditions, and actions to create workflows that nurture leads automatically. When someone opts into your funnel, the system can automatically send them a welcome email, add them to specific lists, schedule follow-up texts, and even notify you when they're showing high engagement. These automations run 24/7, which means your marketing works while you sleep, something that's impossible when you're manually managing everything.

**The Affiliate Stacking Ecosystem: Your Secret Weapon**

Here's where things get really interesting. The "affiliate stacking ecosystem" that Jonathan Montoya built into FunnelFreedom isn't just a fancy marketing term—it's a legitimate strategy for generating multiple income streams simultaneously.

Here's how it works in practice. You create content (or use the pre-made content provided), which gets added to automated email sequences targeting new leads. When someone opts into your lead magnet—maybe a free course or valuable resource—they enter this ecosystem. Over the following days and weeks, they receive a carefully crafted series of emails that provide value, build trust, and naturally introduce various affiliate offers.

The beauty of this system is the multiplication effect. Instead of promoting just one product, you're simultaneously building your email list, nurturing those relationships, and monetizing through multiple affiliate programs. FunnelFreedom comes with integration for 15 different affiliate programs, which means every new subscriber potentially generates multiple commission opportunities.

The done-for-you videos are particularly valuable for beginners who aren't comfortable creating video content yet. These professionally produced videos warm up your leads, explain concepts, and build authority—all without you needing to appear on camera yourself. Your affiliate links are embedded throughout the funnel, so when prospects are ready to buy, they're clicking your links.

One user, as documented in various reviews, made $$796$$ in their first 30 days using this system. Another locked in over $$1,000$$ in monthly recurring commissions within a few weeks. These aren't theoretical numbers—they're real results from people who followed the system and drove traffic to their funnels. The key difference? They didn't waste months building their tech stack or creating content from scratch. They plugged into what was already working.

Speaking of results, now would be a perfect time to see this in action yourself. 👉 [**Click here to explore FunnelFreedom's features**](https://funnelfreedom.io?fpr=li40) and discover how the affiliate stacking ecosystem can work for your business. The 14-day trial gives you full access to everything, so you can test the entire system risk-free.

**Let's Talk Money: Pricing That Actually Makes Sense**

Look, I'm not going to pretend software is free. FunnelFreedom isn't the cheapest option out there, but when you compare it to the alternative of subscribing to multiple platforms, the math becomes really interesting.

Here's the current pricing structure for 2026:

| Plan Type | Trial Period | Monthly Price | Annual Price | What's Included |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Standard Plan** | 14-day free trial | $$97$$/month | $$970$$/year | Unlimited funnels, unlimited contacts, drag-and-drop builder, email/SMS (pay-as-you-go), CRM, social scheduling, done-for-you assets, affiliate programs access |
| **Future Pricing** (Projected) | No trial | $$147$$/month | $$1,470$$/year | Same features, higher cost for new members |
| **Long-term Projection** | No trial | $$297$$/month | $$2,970$$/year | Same features, significantly higher cost |

The pricing strategy here is transparent: early adopters lock in the $$97$$ monthly rate as long as they maintain their subscription. Future pricing will increase as more features are added and the platform matures. This "founder pricing" approach rewards people who join now rather than waiting.

But here's the reality check. If you're currently paying for ClickFunnels ($$97$$ to $$297$$ monthly), an email platform like ConvertKit ($$50$$ to $$100$$ monthly), a CRM like HubSpot ($$50$$ monthly minimum), social media scheduling like Hootsuite ($$49$$ monthly), and calendar booking like Calendly ($$12$$ monthly), you're looking at $$258$$ to $$508$$ monthly just for the basics. FunnelFreedom replaces all of that for $$97$$ monthly, which represents potential savings of $$161$$ to $$411$$ every single month. Over a year, that's $$1,932$$ to $$4,932$$ back in your pocket.

The pay-as-you-go email and SMS model further reduces costs for beginners. Traditional platforms charge you based on list size, which means you're paying even when you're not actively marketing. FunnelFreedom only charges for actual sends, so if you're building slowly, you're not hemorrhaging money on unused capacity.

One important consideration: the 14-day free trial is legitimate. You get full access to everything during those two weeks, which gives you enough time to import contacts, set up your first funnel, and send some test campaigns. If you decide it's not for you, you can cancel before being charged. This trial period removes the risk of commitment, allowing you to evaluate whether the platform truly fits your needs.

**Who Should Actually Use This?**

FunnelFreedom isn't for everyone, and I think it's important to be honest about that. This platform really shines for specific types of people in specific situations.

**You should seriously consider FunnelFreedom if you are:**

A beginner affiliate marketer who's overwhelmed by the technical setup required to get started. If you've spent weeks trying to connect different platforms together and you still don't have a functioning funnel, this solves that problem immediately.

Someone who's been "learning" affiliate marketing for months (or years) without actually launching anything. The done-for-you assets eliminate your excuses. You can be up and running in an afternoon instead of someday in the theoretical future.

An online entrepreneur who's tired of paying for multiple software subscriptions that don't play nicely together. Consolidating your tech stack into one platform reduces both cost and complexity.

A content creator or influencer who wants to monetize your audience through affiliate marketing but doesn't want to become a tech expert. The pre-built funnels and email sequences handle the marketing automation while you focus on creating content.

Someone interested in high-ticket affiliate marketing who needs a professional system to nurture leads through longer sales cycles. The CRM and advanced automation make it possible to manage complex follow-up sequences that convert on expensive offers.

**You probably don't need FunnelFreedom if:**

You already have an established funnel system that's working well and generating consistent income. If you've already invested time building custom funnels and email sequences, switching platforms might not provide enough incremental value to justify the migration effort.

You prefer building everything yourself from scratch and enjoy the technical challenge of customizing every detail. FunnelFreedom is designed for efficiency, not for people who want to tinker with code and build custom integrations.

You're looking for a completely passive income system where you don't need to drive traffic or engage with your audience. No software can replace the fundamental requirement of marketing: you still need to get people into your funnel.

You're broke and can't afford $$97$$ monthly. While the platform provides excellent value, if $$97$$ monthly would strain your budget, you should probably focus on earning income first through lower-cost methods, then invest in tools like this once you have some capital.

The honest truth is that FunnelFreedom is a tool, not a magic button. It dramatically reduces the technical barriers to affiliate marketing, but you still need to drive traffic, engage with your audience, and provide value. The platform makes all of that easier and more automated, but it doesn't eliminate the need for strategic thinking and consistent effort.

Before you invest in any new platform, it makes sense to experience it firsthand. That's why the trial period is so valuable—it lets you test everything without financial commitment. 👉 [**Get started with your free trial today**](https://funnelfreedom.io?fpr=li40) and see whether FunnelFreedom fits your specific situation. You'll know within a week whether this solves your problems or not.

**Real People, Real Results**

Let me share some testimonials from actual FunnelFreedom users, because theory is nice, but results matter more.

Chris McManamy said, "I cannot begin to say how grateful I am for this software—it has streamlined so many of my business operations. The entire hurdle of tech has been completely eliminated." For someone who was stuck in the technical weeds, FunnelFreedom provided the breakthrough they needed.

Jamie Aronson shared, "It's the exact type of software I've been looking for—it's like a miracle. It has solved the issue of how to balance my creative lifestyle while still paying the bills." This speaks to the platform's ability to handle the business operations automatically, freeing up time for the creative work that actually matters.

Vanessa Michelback, a busy mom of four, said, "Funnel Freedom has been life changing. I'm a busy mom who is new and fresh to affiliate marketing. I cannot tell you how much this takes a huge amount of stress off of me right now." The done-for-you assets mean even people with limited time can launch legitimate affiliate marketing businesses.

Chad Burgers, who's been in affiliate marketing for two years, noted, "The biggest constraint I've found is how much time it takes to set up and maintain the business. With this, you could have a fully functional system set up in under an hour. This is genuinely groundbreaking." Coming from someone with experience, this testimonial highlights how FunnelFreedom accelerates setup even for people who know what they're doing.

Ryan McMullen summarized it well: "The Funnel Freedom system is a huge shift in the affiliate marketing industry. It solves the biggest issue affiliate marketers face—the tech side." That's really the core value proposition in one sentence.

These testimonials come from people at different stages of their business journey, which demonstrates the platform's versatility. Whether you're a complete beginner or someone with experience looking to streamline, FunnelFreedom provides tangible value.

**The Features That Matter Most**

Let's dig into the specific features that make the biggest difference in daily use.

**Unlimited Funnels and Websites:** Most funnel builders limit you to a specific number of funnels based on your pricing tier. FunnelFreedom removes that constraint entirely. Build as many funnels as you want—one for each offer, one for each traffic source, one for testing. This freedom allows you to experiment without worrying about hitting arbitrary limits.

**Drag-and-Drop Builder:** The visual editor makes funnel creation intuitive. You can add elements, rearrange sections, change colors, and customize layouts without touching code. If you can use PowerPoint, you can build funnels in FunnelFreedom.

**Hundreds of Proven Templates:** Starting from a blank page is intimidating. The template library gives you professional starting points for opt-in pages, sales pages, webinar funnels, application funnels, and more. Customize them to match your brand and you're live in minutes.

**Email Marketing Automation:** Create sophisticated email sequences that nurture leads over days, weeks, or months. Set up triggers based on behavior—send different follow-ups to people who clicked versus those who didn't. The visual workflow builder makes complex sequences manageable.

**SMS/Text Messaging:** Add another communication channel to your marketing mix. SMS has dramatically higher open rates than email (98% versus 20%), so important messages get seen. Automated text sequences can rescue abandoned carts, remind about appointments, or deliver time-sensitive offers.

**Facebook Messenger Integration:** Reach prospects where they're already spending time. Create Messenger campaigns that feel personal and conversational while still running automatically at scale.

**Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Track every interaction with your contacts in one unified timeline. See which emails they opened, which pages they visited, which offers interested them. This data helps you personalize follow-up and focus energy on your hottest leads.

**Calendar Booking:** Let prospects schedule calls directly into your calendar without the back-and-forth email dance. The system handles time zones, sends reminders, and integrates with your existing calendar software.

**Native Video Hosting:** Upload videos directly to FunnelFreedom instead of relying on YouTube or Vimeo. This gives you complete control over the viewing experience and prevents competitors from distracting your viewers with suggested videos.

**Payment Processing:** Connect Stripe or PayPal and start accepting payments immediately. No separate shopping cart software required.

**Advanced Analytics:** Visualize exactly how leads move through your funnels. Identify where people are dropping off, which pages convert best, and which traffic sources generate the most revenue. Make decisions based on data instead of hunches.

**Courses and Membership Sites:** Create and manage membership areas, online courses, and community spaces directly within FunnelFreedom. No need for separate membership platforms like Kajabi or Teachable.

**Social Media Scheduling:** Plan and automate your social media posts across platforms. Create your content in batches, schedule it out, and let the system handle posting at optimal times.

The integration between all these features is what creates the real power. Your funnel captures a lead, the CRM records their information, an email sequence starts automatically, SMS follow-ups trigger based on behavior, calendar bookings sync with your availability, and analytics track everything. This interconnected ecosystem operates like a well-oiled machine instead of duct-taped components held together with hope.

**How FunnelFreedom Compares to Alternatives**

You're probably wondering how FunnelFreedom stacks up against other popular platforms. Let's do some honest comparisons.

**Versus ClickFunnels:** ClickFunnels is the 800-pound gorilla in funnel builders, and it's excellent at what it does. However, pricing starts at $$97$$ monthly for the basic plan, and you'll quickly hit limits that force upgrades. The Scale plan runs $$197$$ monthly, and if you need advanced features like affiliate management or email automation, you're looking at even higher tiers. ClickFunnels doesn't include CRM functionality, SMS messaging, or social scheduling, so you'll still need additional platforms. FunnelFreedom provides all of that for $$97$$ monthly, making it a more complete solution at a better price point.

**Versus Systeme.io:** Systeme.io is popular among budget-conscious marketers because they offer a free tier and affordable paid plans starting at $$27$$ monthly. However, the free and lower-tier plans come with significant limitations on funnels, contacts, and email sends. FunnelFreedom's unlimited approach removes those constraints. The trade-off is price—you're paying more for FunnelFreedom but getting professional-grade features without limits.

**Versus Kartra:** Kartra is another comprehensive all-in-one platform that competes directly with FunnelFreedom. Pricing starts at $$119$$ monthly for the Starter plan, which includes many similar features. However, Kartra isn't specifically designed for affiliate marketers—it's more generalist. FunnelFreedom's done-for-you affiliate assets, pre-built funnels, and email sequences give it an edge for that specific use case. If you're running an agency or selling your own products, Kartra might be better. If you're focused on affiliate marketing, FunnelFreedom is more purpose-built.

**Versus GoHighLevel:** Here's an interesting one. FunnelFreedom is actually a white-label version of GoHighLevel, so the underlying platform is identical. GoHighLevel costs $$97$$ monthly for their basic plan, same as FunnelFreedom. The difference is what you get on top of the software. GoHighLevel is positioned for agencies managing client accounts, while FunnelFreedom includes the done-for-you affiliate marketing assets, pre-built funnels, proven email sequences, and the affiliate stacking ecosystem. If you're an agency, go with GoHighLevel. If you're an affiliate marketer, FunnelFreedom gives you more value for the same price.

The bottom line on comparisons: FunnelFreedom isn't necessarily "better" than every alternative in every situation. Its sweet spot is affiliate marketers who want comprehensive functionality without managing multiple platforms. The done-for-you assets accelerate your launch, and the all-in-one approach eliminates integration headaches.

**Potential Drawbacks You Should Know About**

I'd be doing you a disservice if I only talked about the positives, so let's address some legitimate concerns and drawbacks.

**Learning Curve:** While FunnelFreedom is designed to be user-friendly, the sheer number of features means there's still a learning curve. If you dive into the advanced automation builder or try to customize everything immediately, you might feel overwhelmed. The solution is to start simple—use the pre-built assets first, then gradually explore advanced features as you grow more comfortable.

**Price for Beginners:** $$97$$ monthly isn't pocket change, especially if you're just starting out and not yet generating income. While the platform saves money compared to multiple subscriptions, that logic only matters if you were planning to buy those subscriptions anyway. For absolute beginners on tight budgets, starting with a cheaper or free platform might make more sense until you're earning enough to justify the investment.

**No Magic Guarantee:** This should be obvious, but the done-for-you assets and automation don't guarantee success. You still need traffic—whether that's paid ads, organic content, social media, or some combination. The platform makes converting that traffic easier and more automated, but it doesn't solve the fundamental challenge of getting people to see your offers.

**Relatively New:** FunnelFreedom launched in late 2023, so it's still relatively young compared to established platforms like ClickFunnels (launched 2014) or Kartra (launched 2018). While the underlying GoHighLevel platform has been around longer and is proven, FunnelFreedom's specific implementation and affiliate marketing focus is newer. This means the community is smaller, there's less third-party training available, and some features might still be evolving.

**Switching Costs:** If you're already using other platforms, migrating to FunnelFreedom involves work. You'll need to rebuild funnels, import contacts, recreate email sequences, and update links. That transition takes time and creates a temporary period of vulnerability where things might break. The long-term benefits often justify this migration pain, but it's a real consideration in the short term.

These drawbacks don't disqualify FunnelFreedom, but they're important factors to weigh in your decision. The 14-day trial helps mitigate some of these concerns by letting you test before fully committing.

**The Verdict: Should You Actually Try FunnelFreedom?**

After diving deep into FunnelFreedom's features, pricing, user experiences, and competitive positioning, here's my honest assessment.

For affiliate marketers who are serious about building a real business but intimidated by the technical setup, FunnelFreedom is probably the best option available in 2026. The combination of powerful all-in-one software plus done-for-you marketing assets solves the two biggest barriers beginners face: technology and content creation.

The platform isn't perfect. It costs money, requires some learning, and doesn't eliminate the need for traffic generation. But it dramatically reduces the time and friction between "wanting to do affiliate marketing" and "actually having a functioning affiliate business."

If you're tired of watching YouTube tutorials about how to connect Zapier to your email platform to your funnel builder, FunnelFreedom cuts through that nonsense. If you've been stuck in planning mode for months, the pre-built assets force you to actually launch. If you're paying for multiple platforms that barely talk to each other, consolidation saves both money and sanity.

The 14-day free trial removes most of the risk. You can set everything up, test it with real traffic, and see actual results before spending a dollar. That's fair. Compare that to platforms requiring immediate payment or only offering 7-day trials that barely give you time to explore.

Here's my recommendation: if you're even moderately curious about affiliate marketing and you're willing to invest $$97$$ monthly in your business growth, try the trial. Worst case, you spend a few hours exploring and decide it's not for you—but you've learned something about modern marketing platforms. Best case, you find the system that finally makes affiliate marketing click for you, and your business transforms.

The people making money with FunnelFreedom aren't inherently smarter or more talented than you. They simply took action, used the system, drove some traffic, and gave it a legitimate shot. That could be you in 30 days if you start now instead of waiting for perfect conditions that never arrive.

Your business deserves better than cobbled-together free tools and endless technical troubleshooting. The time you spend wrestling with software is time you're not spending on revenue-generating activities. FunnelFreedom handles the technical complexity so you can focus on marketing, which is where you should be spending your energy anyway. 👉 [**Take action and start your 14-day free trial now**](https://funnelfreedom.io?fpr=li40)—see for yourself whether this platform is the missing piece in your affiliate marketing puzzle.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Can I really make money with FunnelFreedom?** Yes, but success requires more than just software. FunnelFreedom provides the tools, automation, and done-for-you assets, but you still need to drive traffic to your funnels and engage with your audience. Multiple users have documented earning $$796$$ to over $$1,000$$ in their first 30-60 days using the system, but those results came from consistent effort combined with the platform's capabilities.

**Do I need to create my own videos and emails?** Not initially. FunnelFreedom includes professionally produced videos and proven email sequences you can use immediately. As your business grows and you develop your own brand voice, you can replace these with custom content. Many successful users start with the done-for-you assets and gradually customize over time.

**Is FunnelFreedom suitable for complete beginners?** Absolutely. The done-for-you affiliate system is specifically designed for people who are new to affiliate marketing and overwhelmed by technical setup. The pre-built funnels, email sequences, and video content let you launch quickly without needing extensive marketing knowledge.

**What happens after the 14-day free trial?** If you don't cancel before the trial ends, you'll be charged $$97$$ monthly (or $$970$$ annually if you chose that option). The trial is legitimate—you get full access to everything, and you can cancel anytime during those 14 days without being charged.

**Can I use FunnelFreedom for businesses other than affiliate marketing?** Yes. While the platform is optimized for affiliate marketers with its done-for-you assets, the underlying tools work for any online business. You could use it for coaching, consulting, e-commerce, course creation, local businesses, or agencies. The funnel builder, email automation, CRM, and other features are versatile enough for various business models.

**How does the pay-as-you-go email and SMS pricing work?** Unlike traditional platforms that charge based on contact list size, FunnelFreedom charges based on actual sends. Email costs approximately $$0.001$$ per send, meaning $$10$$ buys about 10,000 email sends. SMS requires adding a phone number (under $$3$$ monthly) and then costs approximately $$10$$ for 970 text messages in the United States. This model is much cheaper for beginners who aren't sending high volumes yet.

**Can I cancel anytime?** Yes. FunnelFreedom operates on a monthly subscription that you can cancel at any time by emailing their support team. There are no long-term contracts or cancellation fees.

**What's the difference between FunnelFreedom and GoHighLevel?** FunnelFreedom is built on the GoHighLevel platform but specifically customized for affiliate marketers. The core software is essentially the same, but FunnelFreedom includes done-for-you affiliate funnels, email sequences, video content, and the affiliate stacking ecosystem. GoHighLevel is more agency-focused, while FunnelFreedom is tailored for individual affiliate marketers.

**Do I need any other tools besides FunnelFreedom?** For most affiliate marketers, FunnelFreedom can replace your funnel builder, email platform, CRM, social media scheduler, calendar booking, and membership site software. You'll still need domain names, potentially paid traffic sources, and payment processing (Stripe or PayPal). But the consolidation eliminates 5-7 separate software subscriptions for most users.

**Is there support if I get stuck?** Yes. FunnelFreedom offers support through live chat (gold bubble in bottom right when logged in), Zoom support calls you can schedule, and email ticketing for billing or complex issues. The support team is available close to 24/7 for technical questions.

The online business landscape is more competitive than ever, but it's also more accessible. Tools like FunnelFreedom have demolished barriers that used to require technical expertise or big budgets. Whether you're escaping the 9-to-5 grind, building a side income, or scaling an existing business, having the right platform makes all the difference. The question isn't whether all-in-one marketing platforms work—they clearly do. The question is whether you'll take advantage of them or keep making excuses. Your future self will either thank you for starting today or wish you had started earlier. The choice is yours.
